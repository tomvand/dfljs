This folder contains recorded RSSI data of test setups. Log files were exported
using python after the minicom log files of each beacon were parsed and
combined.

Log files are included using require(...) and assign an object with the
following structure to the global object 'log':

{
    "data": {
        <timestamp (as string)>: {
            <device address>: {
                <observed address>: [
                    <RSSI (as string)>
                    ...
                ]
            },
            ...
        },
        ...
    },
    "endTimestamp": <last timestamp (as number)>,
    "startTimestamp": <first timestamp (as number)>
}
